Installing WiPPLPy as a Contributor
===================================

This installation is very similar to how PlasmaPy installation is done for 
contributors: https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/contributing/getting_ready.html.
We've done some copy-pasting as to which steps should be followed.

Creating Documentation
======================

To create the documentation, you will need to have `Sphinx`_ installed and 
`make`_. You can install it using pip::

    pip install sphinx

Then, you can create the documentation by entering the ``docs/`` directory and 
running the following command::

    make html
