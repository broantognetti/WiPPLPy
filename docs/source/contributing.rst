Introduction
============

We follow the same design as PlasmaPy for contributing. Please see the `PlasmaPy 
contributing workflow guide <https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/contributing/workflow.html>`_ 
for more information.

This page describes the workflow for making a contribution to WiPPLPy
via a `pull request`_. This page assumes that you have finished the
steps for :ref:`installation`.

Making a code contribution
==========================

.. _create-branch:

Create a new branch
-------------------

#. :ref:`Open a terminal <opening-a-terminal>`.

#. Navigate to the :file:`WiPPLPy/` directory that contains the clone
   of your repository.

#. In the terminal, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git status

   If the output ends with ``nothing to commit, working tree clean``,
   then proceed to the next step.

      .. tip:: What to do with uncommitted changes?

         If ``git status`` shows that any files are listed under
         ``Changes not staged for commit`` or ``Changes to be
         committed``, then do one of the following before proceeding
         to the next step:

         #. :ref:`Add and commit changes <commit-changes>`,

         #. Use `git stash`_ to temporarily file away the changes, or

         #. Use ``git reset --hard`` to **permanently** remove all
            changes to tracked files and return to the previous
            commit.

         If there are untracked files present, then you may delete the
         untracked files, :ref:`add and commit changes <commit-changes>`,
         or proceed to the next step.

#. Download the current status of `WiPPLPy's GitHub repository`_ and
   your fork by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git fetch --all

#. Create and switch to a new branch_ by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout -b new-branch-name upstream/main

   where ``new-branch-name`` is changed to the name of the new branch.
   Here ``upstream`` is the name of the remote_ and ``main`` is the name
   of the original branch.

   .. tip::

      Use descriptive branch names like ``update-contribution-workflow``.

#. Connect your local branch to your fork_ of WiPPLPy on `GitHub`_ by
   running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name

#. If you previously ran ``git stash`` and want to apply those changes to 
   the new branch, run ``git stash pop`` to restore the changes onto the 
   new branch.

.. _commit-changes:

Add and commit changes
----------------------

Next we can go through the cycle of making changes, which can be
repeated multiple times.

#. Edit a file and save the changes.

#. In a terminal, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git add filename

   where :samp:`{filename}` is replaced with the name of the edited
   file(s). Use ``git add *`` to add all files in the directory (except
   for files specified in :file:`.gitignore`). This step lets us line up
   the changes that we want to record as a snapshot in history.

#. To commit the changes, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git commit -m "<commit message>"

   where :samp:`{<commit message>}` is replaced with a descriptive
   commit message such as ``"Add gyroradius function"``.
   Committing a change is like preserving a snapshot of what each file
   looks like at this point in history.

   If it has been installed, pre-commit will perform automated checks
   and possibly make some automated changes. If pre-commit fails, then
   it'll be necessary to do the ``git add`` and ``git commit`` steps
   once more.

#. To push the changes to GitHub, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push

.. tip::

   Try using the ``git status`` command after each step to get a
   better idea of what is happening.

.. note::

   The ``git`` workflow can be thought of as the process of mailing a
   package.

   * ``git add`` is like packing the contents of a package into a box.
     This step allows you to choose which changes to include in the next
     commit.

   * ``git commit`` is like sealing and labeling the package, and
     putting it in the outgoing mail.

   * ``git push`` is like sending the package off to its destination
     (i.e., GitHub).

.. _create-pr:

Creating a pull request
-----------------------

#. Run ``git push`` to make sure that branch on GitHub is up-to-date.

#. Go to `WiPPLPy's GitHub repository`_.

#. If you recently pushed new changes, a pale yellow box will appear
   near the top of the screen. In that box, click
   :guilabel:`Compare & pull request`.

   .. note::

      If you did not recently push any new changes, click on
      :guilabel:`New pull request` and then the link saying "compare
      across forks." Select ``WiPPLPy/WiPPLPy`` for "base repository"
      and ``main`` for "base". Choose your fork of PlasmaPy for "head
      repository" and the name of the branch for "compare".  Then click
      on :guilabel:`Create pull request`.

#. Add a descriptive title, such as
   ``Add a function to calculate particle gyroradii``.

#. Write a description for the pull request (PR). Describe the
   changes, and why they are being made. Include information that you
   think would be helpful for reviewers, future users, and future
   contributors..

   .. tip::

      If your pull request will resolve an issue, include
      :samp:`Closes #{ISSUE-NUMBER}` in the pull request description,
      where :samp:`{ISSUE-NUMBER}` is replaced with the number of the
      issue.

#. Select :guilabel:`Create pull request`.

   .. tip::

      If the pull request isn't ready for review, select the
      :guilabel:`â–¼` next to :guilabel:`Create pull request` to enable
      you to create a draft pull request instead.

   .. note::

      After the pull request has been created, it can be updated by
      using ``git push`` to update the corresponding branch on
      GitHub.

At this stage, a reviewer will perform a code review, unless it has been
marked as a draft pull request. Thank you for contributing!
